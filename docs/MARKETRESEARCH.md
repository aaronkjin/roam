# Market Research

## Introduction/Market Landscape

The travel planning market has expanded with numerous web-based consumer tools that

help individuals and groups organize trips. In fact, “there are now so many travel planning

websites and apps to choose from, it’s hard to decipher which are the most useful.”

(https://www.suewherewhywhat.com/trip-planning-websites/). Traditional trip planning

often relied on spreadsheets, email threads, and group chats, but travelers today expect

smoother, centralized planning. This is especially true for group travel, where coordinating

schedules, budgets, and preferences among multiple people can be very challenging. Modern

trip planning platforms aim to alleviate these pain points by providing a single place to

collect itineraries, bookings, and collaborative inputs.

Notably, group trip planning is evolving beyond just ad-hoc tools. A number of

consumer-focused web apps now address this need for smoother, dedicated group trip

planning tools that keep everything connected, where they offer features like shared

itineraries, collaborative editing, budget tracking, and more. We will analyze key competitors

in the web-based consumer trip planning space, from itinerary aggregators to new

collaborative planning apps, and identify a potential niche for our product.

## Problem Space

Despite the growth of these travel planning tools, planning a real trip still tends to sprawl across

multiple sites and workflows. Travelers commonly research options in one place, book through

different vendors, then fall back to methods like spreadsheets and group chats to keep everything

straight. That fragmentation creates predictable, recurring friction in three places:

1. Stitching together bookings made across multiple vendors into a single coherent plan,

2. Keeping confirmations confirmations, reservations, and trip details organized and easy to

retrieve,

3. And coordinating group decisions and information sharing when multiple people are

involved (e.g. who decides, who books, who tracks what, and how plans change over
time).

This aligns with how we set up our study. When screening, we target people who plan trips with
at least some regularity, where their costs for coordination and information management
compounds. When interviewing, we explicitly probe tool-switching, moments when users get
“stuck,” post-booking organization, and the mechanics of group coordination and
decision-making.
